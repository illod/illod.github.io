i really like a lot of foods. i think that my favorite has got to be fried rice.

specifically the fried rice with spam?

i know some people think that spam is gross.

but i think that it tastes nice when turned into little pieces...

little cute spam cubes.

and to drink?

i didn't think that far ahead.....

water is nice when you're thirsty.
