sometimes i want a bit more out of my existence... do i need to go <a href="life.html">back?</a> i'm kind of <a href="motivation.html">tired.</a>







...i'll get up.











<pre style="text-align: center; padding-top: 60px; margin: 0; position: relative; overflow-x: hidden; font-size: 1.25vw;">
i want to be like those people in the television. on the stage. in my imagination.

i want to create something. a legacy. or just make a mark on the world that will last after me.



i could do so many things.






i can learn to paint, code, write.

and if i find out i don't want to do any of that...







i could always help those i love.














that's okay too.

nothing is too little of an impact.

i'll still find something i love but...










in the meantime...


























helping might be just enough.




















i'm glad you're here. you took the time to know me.
