i don't really feel safe here.

in my body i feel like i need to hold my hands over my face. sorry if that's weird. i didn't mean to be weird.









do you feel safe?













not just where you live in your physical form but where you live in your mind?

it's not enough to know that i am safe from harm.

life isn't just about staying alive. it's not clinical.
