i've just been kind of feeling like i <a href="demotivation.html">can't do anything.</a> waking up and getting <a href="sustenance.html">something</a> to eat is a chore.

but i know it's necessary.








but sometimes it feels like such a slllloooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooogggggg. ahahahahah.




hahahahah...hahahahah







hahahah....











hahha.....
















hah....






















ah...



























anyways,















are you happy with what you are?





















i mean i've got somebody to care about me. and i care about others.

maybe i need to learn to be okay with what i am...

present myself as what i am and...





show that to people instead.
















even if people don't really like me i'll try to be independent.

and eventually i can find the group that's right for me.
