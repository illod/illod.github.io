it's nice to have someone you care about and even nicer to know that somebody cares for you.

do you understand?






everybody i grew up around said i was nice but only a few of them actually wanted a conversation.

maybe you could <a href="friend.html">join</a> the few that care. don't feel pressured if you don't want to.
